DupEval
========

This is an alternative to _why's mix_eval C extension. It provides identical functionality to mix_eval as well as the following extra functionality:
* Ability to mix in Objects/Classes (using Object2module)
* Thread-safety

DupEval is a development on work originally by coderrr (http://coderrr.wordpress.com) and based on his cool idea for dupping the binding of a block 
(http://coderrr.wordpress.com/2008/11/14/making-mixico-thread-safe/)

NOTE:
DupEval is still in proof of concept stage, use at own risk!
